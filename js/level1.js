/*  How does a web form work?

    1. A visitor visits a web page that contains a form.
    2. The web browser displays the HTML form.
    3. The visitor fills in the form and submits
    4. The browser sends the submitted form data to the web server
    5. A form processor script running on the web server processes the form data.
       The processing steps can include:
          - sending the form submission by email
          - saving the submission to a database table or a file.
    6. A response page is sent back to the browser.

    The parts of a web form
    A standard web form has the following parts:
    1. The HTML code for the form (read in more details at html-form-description.txt file)
    2. Input validations.
    3. Form processor script.
