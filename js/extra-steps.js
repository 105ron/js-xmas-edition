/*

Now that you have completed all the three levels.. You can try few of these as additional exercises.

- In level2 and level3 , instead of using local storage, make use of DB to store and retrieve values
- In level2, why dont you save the images the user adds to local storage and use them in level3
- In level3, instead of using the images from img/gifts folder, get the images from the web based on the gift description and store them
you could use ajax calls, get the images from flickr/google-images/ instagram
